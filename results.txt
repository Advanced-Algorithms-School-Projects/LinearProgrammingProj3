The goal of this project was to implement ILP formulations of the knapsack and
graph coloring problems. The knapsack ILP formulation was done by maximizing 
the sum of the value of selected objects and constraining the sum of the cost 
of selected objects to be less than or equal to the cost limit. For the graph 
coloring ILP formulation, we minimized the sum of all conflicts and set a 
conflict to 1 if there was a edge between 2 nodes with the same color. When 
run, the knapsack proved to solve all the given instances very fast similar to
the previous greedy algorithm implementation and faster than the exhaustive
algorithm. When running graph coloring, most of the instances were solved very
fast like the greedy algorithm but some of the larger instances with fewer 
colors were cut off at 10 minutes like the exhaustive algorithm. Less of the 
instances were cut off at 10 minutes compared to the exhaustive algorithm. This
proves that though the ILP implementation may be slower than the greedy 
algorithm, it is still faster than the exhaustive algorithm.
